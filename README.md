A Pomodoro Timer built using ReactJS.

# What is the Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. [3] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. -Provided by Everipedia

# How it works
This timer will help you stay productive throughout the day. The timer switches between a 25 minute work and 4 minute break intervals. However, users can edit their work/break intervals.
